            <p>Few things are more important to business owners than the value of their business. The valuation you get for your business can make or break a proposition.</p>
            <p>Whether you're negotiating a merger, considering new shareholders, attempting to resolve disputes associated with liability, shareholder equity, estate planning or marital dissolution, objective valuation can make the difference between loss or gain, success or failure.</p>
            <p>Business valuation is not an exact science. It's based on judgment, experience and relevant information. So, you need professionals who are well qualified, with significant experience in evaluating all types of organizations.</p>
